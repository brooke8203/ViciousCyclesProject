<h1>Equipment</h1>

<h2>Helmets</h2>
<p>We posess many types of helmets from child sizes to adult sizes. All of our current helmets undergo many tests to
    achieve the best quality for your safety. Every helmet we own protects the brain using expanded polystyrene foam
    which is used to abord shock. The helmet styles range from pop culture graphics to solid color bases. </p>

<h3>Bike locks</h3>
<p>Bike theft is an unfortunate part of cycling, but a good bike lock can help protect you. With an assortment
    of locks to choose from we always test each item to ensure the quality of your product. Our locks are categorized by
    Bronze, Silver or Gold. Gold level locks have the highest rating of survival against top level tools. Our most
    popular lock are the U and D locks because of the difficulty to unlock by a theif. </p>

<h4>Bike Lights</h4>
<p>The law requires that you have a front light and red rear light when you ride before dawn or after dusk. The
    brightness is categorized by 'lumens' in which you want lights to be seen or lights to see. All of our lights
    include a USB battery charging cable to keep the lights charged.</p>

<h5>Cycling Pedals</h5>
<p>The bulk of our bikes include pedals but unfortunatly not all include them. A majority of the cyclists that come in
    prefer Look pedals of Shimano clipless pedals. Our pedals have very effective power and are not too pricey.</p>

<h6>Multi Tools</h6>
<p>If you decide to purchase a pre made bike, the smartest idea to follow would include purchasing multi tools. Multi
    tools can help you make adjustments as well as fix heights and tweak the bar angle. 2-8mm Allen Key bolts have the
    best quality because of its small size and easy adjustments.</p>
